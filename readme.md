##proSifter

A web app that allows a user to search and "sift" through companies and their reviews. Companies can be searched by name or by category. Users can see an average rating for each company and rate them themselves. If users sign up, their personal review can be recorded for a specific company. An administration page was made available to manage users for the app as well.

It was built using PHP, JQuery with AJAX, HTML, CSS, Twitter Bootstrap, and Laravel. 

ProSifter was created during a Codeup bootcamp cohort. It was created in a 10 day time frame with a 3 memeber team as a final project.
